# Dice-challenge
The Drum Kit Challenge is an interactive web-based project where users can play virtual drum sounds using their keyboard or by clicking on on-screen drum elements. Each drum is associated with a unique sound and can be triggered in real time, providing a fun and dynamic way to create rhythms.
